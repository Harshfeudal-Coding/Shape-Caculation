# Shape Caculation
A new way to self-learning Object-Oriented Programming in C++ by caculating the shape area (rectangle and circle).

## Attention
This project just only for who are self-learning C++. I know C++ OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) kinda hard for who has just started in learning it.
I haven't clarified the code too much on here so if you would like to know why I use it just send a Direct Message [on my Discord personal profile]().

## Testing
If you want to run test just use Visual Studio 2022 and open solution file `.sln`, or if you're using Visual Studio Code, please create a `CMake.txt` file and pre-set
it so that you can run it (I'm not good at setting up C++ project on Visual Studio Code, just know the way to pre-set it).
